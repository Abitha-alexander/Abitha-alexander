First, install venv for Python 3.10: 
   apt install -y python3.10-venv
After venv has been installed, create a virtual environment:
   $ python3 -m venv ciscou
Now, activate the virtual environment:
   $ source ciscou/bin/activate
    (ciscou) #
For Windows directly, using the terminal, shell, or even PowerShell, the steps are slightly different.
First, ensure that Python is installed on your Windows system. You can download it from the official Python website (https://python.org). During installation, make sure to select the option to Add Python to PATH.
Open the command prompt (cmd) or PowerShell and navigate to the directory where you want to create your virtual environment. Then, run the following command to create a virtual environment named ciscou:
python -m venv ciscou
After creating the virtual environment, you will need to activate it. The command differs slightly, depending on whether you are using the command prompt or PowerShell.
For the command prompt, use:
ciscou\Scripts\activate
